'''In a file called camel.py, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a variable in camel case and outputs the corresponding name in snake case. 
Assume that the userâ€™s input will indeed be in camel case.'''

for character in camel:

print() # Print a new line since the other print functions didn't.
